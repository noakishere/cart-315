### Game Design Journal process

Design journaling procedure based on [MDM Framework](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdm)

## Design Journal: Ideas

- Design Journal: Conceptualizing - Journal about your ideation process. Include any Design Values, Precedents, and your 3 favourite ideas. These don't have to be very detailed, just a few sentences to capture the main game concept.

My teammate and I discussed potential ideas for our final prototype. The ideas were:

1. An FPS city-builder, management game wwhere you play as the manager.
2. A hoarder game where hoarding has double affects within the game itself.
3. Metroidvania game with an alzheimer status, as the more it raises, the more confusing the visited rooms will be.

## Design Journal - Prototype Stage 1

- Journal about the first stage of your prototyping process. What was your idea? What specific questions where you trying to answer (goals)? Was it a look/feel, role, implementation prototype?What fidelity levels are you dealing with? What did you learn and what are the next steps?

We met to discuss our favourite idea. We decided on an FPS game where each level aims to reveal that it's a lost memory of an alzheimer's patient. The shooting aspect of the game will be explored as a metaphor to how coping is manifested regarding difficult memories and how they're navigated. We want some horror aspects present (a la Alan Wake) to make the combat compelling and interesting, but only when it serves the narrative.

## Design Journal: Prototyping Stage 2

We explored some game inspirations:

- What remains of edith finch
- Firewatch
- Dear Esther
- Alice Madness Returns
- Before I forget
- Psyshonauts
- mailman
- Control
- Alan Wake

Also, discussed game direction and more game design elements but nothing set in stone yet. We're still exploring what should be done in terms of narrative and how the combat could look like. We also discussed potential objects in the game that are directly tied to the alzheimer bar status.

## Design Journal: Prototyping Stage 3

Some minimal programming was done as the project is made in Unity. However before making any technical decisions, we explored some themes and game design decisions for the prototype itself.

We have decided to have 3 core stats in the game:

1. Sanity
   - Sanity serves as the amount of resources exerted in order to complete the run. If all sanity is lost, one must start the run again. High Sanity levels could mean clearer levels and objectives, whereas lower Sanity might result in distorted environments, confusing objectives, or hallucinations.
2. Focus

   - Represents the protagonist's ability to concentrate and navigate through the relative's memories.
     You might have to sacrifice Sanity in order to Focus on the plot at hand, however you gain Clarity for your next run.

3. Lucidity
   - Indicates the protagonist's understanding and awareness within the relative's mind. You get to have more Clarity by understanding the lore better.

Also the main collectibles, memories, serve as collectibles that help piece together the relative's life story and the underlying narrative.Collecting Memory Fragments could unlock backstory elements, reveal secrets, or provide insights that help with game progression. You gather memories by using your Sanity.

We have also decided to have multiple weapon types that reflect on different coping mechanisms such as: Resilience, Avoidant, Displacement, etc.

## Design Journal: Prototyping Stage 4

Some programming was done for First person controller scripts of the game itself. Ready to implement the weapons and some level design for the final prototype next week. :P no further reiterations on the design itself are done until we have something tangible to test in the next few days.
